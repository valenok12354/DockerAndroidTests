The project has been created to speed up and automate the process of testing
Xiaomi devices. Project works fine with the preconditions:
1. InellijiIdea community edition. 2020.2.3 https://www.jetbrains.com/ru-ru/idea/
2. Appium 1.18.3 http://appium.io/
3. Java JDK 1.8.0_271

All locators that marked with TODO annotation should be customized for language
that device use.
To speed up the process two patterns were used. Refactoring is in plans.
